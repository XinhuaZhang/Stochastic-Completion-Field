## Installation and build guide
This installation guide is for Linux/Ubuntu operating system. There are no plans for Windows and Apple though we don't believe there should be much problems with self-modifying the steps.
1. Install <a href="https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/README/#how-to-install>">Stack</a>. (Stack will include Haskell). 
   - Stack is a tool to build and manage packages for Haskell programs.
   * For Ubuntu, this is as simple as running on the command line: 
     ```bash
     curl -sSL https://get.haskellstack.org/ | sh
     ```
     or
     ```bash
     wget -qO- https://get.haskellstack.org/ | sh
     ```
   * You may want to run the following command to install/update system dependencies on Ubuntu:
     ```bash
     sudo apt-get install g++ gcc libc6-dev libffi-dev libgmp-dev make xz-utils zlib1g-dev git gnupg netbase
     ```
   * <a href="https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/install_and_upgrade/">Stack full installation guide</a>
   
2. Install <a href="http://www.fftw.org/">fftw3</a>. 
   - FFTW "is a C subroutine library for computing the discrete Fourier transform (DFT)".
   - In Ubuntu, do:
     ```bash
     sudo apt-get install libfftw3-dev libfftw3-doc
     ```

   - Below is for manual install (incomplete):
     * Download and/or extract the latest stable release.
     * Open a new command line terminal and navigate to the folder with the downloaded files.
     * In succession, input the following commands:
       ```bash
       ./configure
       ```
       ```bash
       make
       ```
       ```bash
       sudo make install
       ```
   * <a href="http://www.fftw.org/fftw3_doc/Installation-and-Customization.html">FFTW3 full installation guide<a/>. Linux/Ubuntu is an Unix system.
	
3. Install <a href="http://www.netlib.org/blas/">BLAS</a> and <a href="http://www.netlib.org/lapack/">LAPACK<a/>. 
   - BLAS "are routines that provide standard building blocks for performing basic vector and matrix operations".
   - LAPACK "provides routines for solving systems of simultaneous linear equations, least-squares solutions of linear systems of equations, eigenvalue problems, and singular value problems".
   * For Ubuntu:
     ```bash
     sudo apt-get install libblas-dev liblapack-dev
     ```
	
4. Download/clone this repository. <a href="https://help.github.com/en/articles/cloning-a-repository">GitHub guide to cloning directory</a>.

5. On the command line, navigate to your local version of this repo.

6. Build program with 
   ```bash
   stack build
   ```
